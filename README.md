# Football World Cup Score Board
===
You are working on a sports data company, and we would like you to develop a new Live
Football World Cup Score Board that shows matches and scores.

## The board supports the following operations:
1. **Start a game.**
   Our data partners will send us data for the games when they start, and these should capture (Initial score is 0 – 0).
   a. Home team
   b. Away team

2. **Finish game.**
   It will remove a match from the scoreboard.

3. **Update score.**
   Receiving the pair score; home team score and away team score and updates a game score.

4. **Get a summary of games by total score.**
   Those games with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently added to our system.
   As an example, being the current data in the system:
   a. Mexico - Canada: 0 - 5
   b. Spain - Brazil: 10 – 2
   c. Germany - France: 2 – 2
   d. Uruguay - Italy: 6 – 6
   e. Argentina - Australia: 3 - 1

   The summary would provide with the following information:
    1. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
    2. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
    3. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
    4. Argentina 3 - Australia 1
    5. Germany 2 - France 2


## Implementation decisions
1. **Start a game.**

   I have added an **Id** field. This field should be the identifier in the database. In this case I calculate the value using the length of the list.

3. **Update score.**

   I have added the possibility to update homeTeamScore and awayTeamScore interchangeably. In a real match you can update only one value or two values.

4. **Get a summary of games by total score.**

   For this functionality I have used the **Id** field to do the second sorting.
